# recruitment-system
Developed a Recruitment Management program in Java designed to streamline the hiring process for
 administrators, companies, and applicants. The system enabled administrators to manage users and
 generate comprehensive reports on recruitment activities and applicant data. Companies could effectively
 manage their job postings, review applications, and communicate decisions, while applicants gained the
 ability to search for jobs, apply, and track application statuses.
